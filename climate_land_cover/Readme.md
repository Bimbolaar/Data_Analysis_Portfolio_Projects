Climate data analysis shows changes in land cover over time, grouping land cover into those types that have climate-influencing, climate-regulating, and climate-neutral impacts.
Annual estimates of land cover and Climate Altering Land Cover Index are presented at country and regional levels for 1992-2020.
Estimates of land cover are presented in thousand hectares and the Climate Altering Land Cover Index is unitless.
